## 💡 About Me

I'm a backend engineer with **5+ years** building high-performance, multi-tenant security platforms and real-time trading systems. I specialize in:

- **Multi-tenant SaaS architectures** at scale (1000+ tenants, sub-100ms latency)
- **High-throughput packet processing** and Linux network isolation
- **Event-driven microservices** on AWS (Lambda, Kafka, DynamoDB)
- **Fintech automation** (algorithmic trading, broker API integration)

I approach every system with a focus on **scalability, security, and observability**—from packet-level to cloud infrastructure.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### **Multi-Tenant Virtual Firewall Platform**
On-premises virtual firewall supporting multiple virtual firewalls on a single Debian machine with tenant isolation, packet processing, and security policies.

**Tech Bash/Shell Scripts, Golang (optional CLI tools), iptables/nftables, Linux Namespaces, Debian OS
**Key Achievements:**
- Supports multiple virtual firewalls on single Debian machine (capacity depends on system resources: CPU, RAM, network)
- Deployed via shell scripts with iptables/nftables for packet processing
- Linux namespaces for strict virtual firewall isolation
- Sub-millisecond policy evaluation using kernel-level netfilter rules

## 🏗️ System Design Approach

**My process for building scalable systems:**

1. **Requirements Analysis** – Identify scalability, latency, consistency, and security needs
2. **Architecture Design** – Choose between microservices, monolith, or event-driven based on constraints
3. **Performance PoC** – Benchmark, profile, and optimize before full implementation
4. **Hardening** – Add security, multi-tenancy, error handling, and recovery
5. **Observability** – Implement logging, metrics, tracing, and alerting
6. **Rollout Strategy** – Canary deployments, blue-green, feature flags, gradual rollout
